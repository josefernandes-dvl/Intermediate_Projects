# Intermediate_Projects
Intermediate-level projects, with moderate complexity, modularization, deeper interactions and moderate use of data structures.

# 1. Grading System (carried out before learning OOP)

For a greater elaboration of data control, with manipulations and interactions between arrays and their methods (in addition to modularization with method creation), I developed a Grading System with weighted averages, grade control and tools to facilitate data filtering for the teacher.

# 2. Tic Tac Toe (carried out before learning OOP)

Project produced to increase my skills with matrices, creation and interaction between methods, use of whiles and boolean values. Systems such as switching between players and checking for a tie, victory or invalid command were built to bring interaction and loyalty to the program.
