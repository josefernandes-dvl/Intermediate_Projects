# Intermediate_Projects
Intermediate-level projects, with moderate complexity, modularization, deeper interactions and moderate use of data structures.

# 1. Grading System

For a greater elaboration of data control, with manipulations and interactions between arrays and their methods (in addition to modularization with method creation), I developed a Grading System with weighted averages, grade control and tools to facilitate data filtering for the teacher.
